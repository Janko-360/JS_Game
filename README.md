# JS_Game

A browser based game. 
This was the first JS project. Getting to know JavaScript and programming concepts. The module leaders got us going and we elaborated on the functionality. My work includes the level and lives mechanic. Also, the graphic styling and overhaul with next level and end game screens.     

The game play is a simple platform jumper to collect items to increase the score. With the classic increasing difficulty for every level and a lives mechanic. As stated, the game is based on JavaScript. It also uses the P5.js and P5 sound library to enable visual renderings in the browser with small animations and sound.

## How to run the game
It is a browser based game. So, launch it from your IDE or upload it to a webserver and access the IP address.  

In my case I used VSCode and the Live Server extension.
