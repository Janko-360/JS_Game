# JS_Game

A browser based game. 
This was the first JS project. Getting to know JavaScript and programming concepts. The module leaders got us going with and we elaborated on the functionality. My work includes the level and lives mechanic. Also, the graphic styling and overhaul with next level and end game screens.     

The goal of the game is simple. Collect all the boxes for points. Reach the fag poles for the next level and try to get a high score at the end of level 3. Of course the levels get more difficult and later enemies can take the player lives.

## How to run the game
It is a browser based game. So, launch it from your IDE or upload it to a webserver and access the IP address.  

In my case I used VSCode and the Live Server extension.
